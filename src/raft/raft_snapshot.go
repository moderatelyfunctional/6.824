// tester) on the same server, via the applyCh passed to Make(). set
// CommandValid to true to indicate that the ApplyMsg contains a newly
// committed log entry.

// in part 2D you'll want to send other kinds of messages (e.g.,
// snapshots) on the applyCh, but set CommandValid to false for these
// other uses.
